### Blurb
It's a hot laps tournament! You'll race one lap at a time, in groups of 5-8. You'll get at least three laps: a seed round to sort you into the elimination brackets, an elimination round, and either a final (determining the winner) or a "small final" (determining the best of the rest). Additional rounds may be necessary in larger fields so when in doubt, stay tuned to the officials and race staff who will keep everyone on track.
